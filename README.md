# Floppy_adaptor V2.5
Converts PC floppy drive interface to Amiga/Shugart bus interface. Now also supports the Atari ST/TT. Only supports Double Density (DD) disks but works with an HD drive in DD mode.

The native files in EagleCAD format are included. The Zip file contains the Gerber data.
# 2021 Update.
I'm discontinuing sales of all Amiga related projects. Reduced order volumes and extra issues with order post Brexit have not made it viable to continue.
All information, including BOMs, Gerbers and notes are now in the repository, if you want to build your own.

The design supports use as an external drive, see the file External_drive_wiring_V2.png for details.
